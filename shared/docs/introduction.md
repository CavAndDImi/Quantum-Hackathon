## Introduction to Quantum Computing

Quantum computing represents a fundamental shift in how we process information, leveraging quantum mechanical phenomena like superposition and entanglement to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers.

## Core Quantum Concepts

### 1. Quantum Bits (Qubits)
Unlike classical bits that are either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in a **superposition** of both states:

```
|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
```

Where α and β are complex probability amplitudes satisfying |α|² + |β|² = 1.

### 2. Quantum Gates
Quantum gates are unitary operations that manipulate qubits:

- **Hadamard Gate (H)**: Creates superposition
- **Pauli Gates (X, Y, Z)**: Bit and phase flips
- **CNOT Gate**: Creates entanglement
- **Phase Gates (S, T)**: Apply phase rotations

### 3. Quantum Circuits
Quantum algorithms are implemented as sequences of quantum gates applied to qubits, often ending with measurements.
